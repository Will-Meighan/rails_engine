I was able to get all my rails_engine tests passing through the search functionalities. That being said, I was having a lot of trouble with the rails_driver spec harness. I kept getting either nil values or blank values. From talking with some classmates, I think it may have to do with my params, but I couldn't get it figured out, so the spec harness probably doesn't look good. I put in a pull request for my attempt at the most revenue, but didn't merge it since I couldn't quite get that one working. All in all, I struggled pretty mightily with this one, but much more towards the beginning and felt better as the week went along.
